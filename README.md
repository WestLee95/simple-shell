Hereâ€™s a more polished and detailed `README.md` for your shell project. I've included sections that explain the project, how to build and run it, features, and example usage.

# Shell Project

## Overview
This project is a custom shell implementation in C, designed to handle basic command execution, input/output redirection, and command history. It aims to provide an interactive environment similar to popular Unix/Linux shells, with a focus on simplicity and functionality.

## Features
- **Command Execution**: Supports execution of external commands and internal commands.
- **Command History**: Tracks the last 100 commands entered by the user and allows access via a `history` command.
- **Pipelines**: Supports piping between multiple commands.
- **Input/Output Redirection**: Allows redirection of input/output streams using file descriptors.

## File Structure

- **`shell.c`**: Main source file that implements command parsing, execution, and history management.
- **`shell.h`**: Header file containing constants, structure definitions, and function declarations.
- **`Makefile`**: Script to build the shell program.
- **`demo_run.txt`**: Example commands and usage of the shell.
- **`README.md`**: This documentation file.

## Compilation and Setup

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have a C compiler (such as GCC) and `make` installed on your system.

### Build
To compile the project, use the `Makefile`:
```bash
make
```

This will generate an executable file named `shell`.

### Run the Shell
Once compiled, you can start the shell with the following command:
```bash
./shell
```

## Usage

### Example Commands
- **Basic Commands**:
  ```bash
  ls -l
  pwd
  cat file.txt
  ```
  
- **Command History**:
  ```bash
  history  # Displays the list of previously entered commands
  ```

- **Piping**:
  ```bash
  ls -l | grep txt
  ```

- **Input/Output Redirection**:
  ```bash
  cat < input.txt > output.txt
  ```

### Exiting the Shell
To exit the shell, you can type:
```bash
exit
```

## Project Structure and Code Walkthrough

### `shell.c`
This file contains the core logic of the shell, including:
- **Command Parsing**: Breaks down the user input into command and arguments.
- **Execution**: Handles execution using `fork()` and `execvp()` to run commands.
- **History Management**: Keeps a history of user commands and allows replaying.

### `shell.h`
Defines the constants and data structures such as:
- **`struct command`**: Represents a parsed command with its arguments.
- **`struct commands`**: Stores multiple commands in a pipeline.

### `Makefile`
Used to automate the build process. It compiles the source code into an executable file.

## Known Limitations
- The shell does not handle background processes or job control.
- Command line length and argument count are limited to 1024.
- No support for advanced shell features like environment variable expansion or aliasing.

## Future Enhancements
- **Job Control**: Adding support for background processes and job management.
- **Tab Completion**: Implementing autocompletion for command and file names.
- **Signal Handling**: Improving signal handling for commands like `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT).
